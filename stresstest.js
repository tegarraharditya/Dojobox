/*

    Stress Testing is a type of load testing used to determine the limits of the system.
    The purpose of this test is to verify the stablility and reliability of the system under extreme conditions.

    Run a stress to:
    - Determine how your system will behave under extreme conditions.
    - Determine what is the maximum capacity of your system in terms of users or throughput.
    - Determine if your system will recover without manual intervention after the stress test is over.
